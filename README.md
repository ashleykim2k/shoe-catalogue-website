# MIA

As shoe lovers, we created a space where our favorite brands and shoe categories could be displayed. We solely focused on shoes that were both, comfortable and luxurious. MIA shoe catalogue's purpose is to inspire those who are seeking for a classic yet fashionable shoe option.
"
The site starts at a homepage that introduces the brand style and establishes the brand purpose. Using the navigation bar at the top, users can navigate to a "Browse" page, which lists all the shoe categories available in our catalogue. When the user clicks on a category name, they are taken to a page that shows all the shoes in that category, and they are able to view the brand name, shoe name, and price. Lastly, the "About" page serves as a place where users can go to find more information about the brand's mission and purposes. Across these different pages, we use text styling and animation to make the content more intriguing.

## Note to Professor Bharghava:
You will notice that when filtering the shoes by category, we separated the data by category as well. Initially, I tried to use .filter on the main dataset (data.csv) to filter by category, and I was able to successfully filter the data for a given category, but when I tried to do this for another category, I found that the product cards were not displaying in the other categories. For example, when I used .filter on the Sandals and then tried to .filter on the Sneakers, the Sneaker product cards displayed but the Sandal product cards disappeared.
